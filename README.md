# User Story

(This is just hypothetical; I think that just the Food Nutrition API is good enough for the project but we can easily put in a quick Google Maps query for directions to the restuarant at the end)

* As a User I want an application I can use to order burgers from that will also provide me with nutritional information about my order.
* When I go to the website I can create an account to save my information
* When I select food items from the restuarant menu
* Then I can view my ordered items at the chackout point
* I can view my order's Nutritional information before I place my order
* When I place my order
* I receive information about the distance between my house and the restuarant
* And a receipt of payment for my order
* Then I can order again
